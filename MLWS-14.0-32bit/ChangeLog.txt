	Started to work on the Microlinux Enterprise Workstation. The idea behind
	MLWS is to build a no-nonsense, one-app-per-task KDE desktop with sensible
	default settings and a minimum of cruft. Ideally, some of KDE's Rube Goldberg
	apps like KMail, Amarok and KTorrent will be replaced by some more
	lightweight stuff.
